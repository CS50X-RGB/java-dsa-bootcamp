8. Write a program which will ask the user to enter his/her marks (out of 100). Define a method that will display grades according to the marks entered as below:
Marks        Grade
91-100         AA
81-90          AB
71-80          BB
61-70          BC
51-60          CD
41-50          DD
<=40          Fail



9. Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 'Factorial'.
Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) *n. E.g.-
4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
Also,
1! = 1
0! = 1
